This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming involving ambiguous type variables in polymorphic functions. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from the compiler's inability to infer the specific type of a polymorphic function when used without explicit type information. The solution shows how to resolve the ambiguity using type annotations.
