This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function with a type that's not fully specified, leading to an ambiguous type variable error.

```haskell
myFunction :: a -> a
myFunction x = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = myFunction 5
  print result
```

The issue is in `main`. While `myFunction` is defined to work with any type `a`, the compiler doesn't know what type `a` should be when applied to the integer 5. This can be addressed by specifying the type of `result`.
